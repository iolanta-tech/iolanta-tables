  🗨: How to unit test mkdocs-iolanta-tables?
  💡:
    - 🗨: With pure iolanta
      👍:
        # I wonder whether 👍 + 🗨 can be inferred from 👍 automatically.
        - 🗨: Simpler code of the unit tests

        - ∃: root-context-from-plugins
          🗨: Root context is assembled via MkDocs plugins
        - ∃: we-are-testing-mkdocs-here
          🗨: Testing Iolanta would be similar to a unit test, and testing MkDocs is more of an integration test which is a more comprehensive solution.
        - ∃: test-mkdocs-yml
          🗨: If testing via MkDocs we can also check mkdocs.yml, with pure iolanta we cannot.
    - 🗨: Via MkDocs
