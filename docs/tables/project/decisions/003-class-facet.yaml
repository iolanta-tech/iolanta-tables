  - title: There is no way for `TableRow` facet to find the column list when rendering a `table:class`
    branches:
       - title: Use the table itself as rendering target
         # Is this `contra` right?
         contra:
           - title: Inconsistent against the table:rows implementation
             description: table:rows uses its auto generated blank node
       - title: Generate a blank node unique per table and use it as rendering target
         description: |
           - $table table:class ?blank .
           - ?blank table:use-class $class .

               - title: "$container: $list"
                 description: Works! Creates a list. However, it is unclear what semantics multiple classes would have. A cartesian product?..
               - title: "$container: …"
                 description: Does not work, does not create an empty node.
               - title: "$nest: …"
                 description: Inapplicable.
               - title: "$…: …"
                 description: Haven't found anything suitable ☹
           - title: With OWL

           - title: With Python
             branches:
               - title: Generate YAML files
                 description: how does relate to Iolanta? It isn't necessarily able to create files anywhere
               - title: Write triples to the graph directly
